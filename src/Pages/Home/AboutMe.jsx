                        After few years of managing client accounts, I've decided to change my qualification, as I found deep interest in programming.
                        This summer I completed a program called "From JAVA Basics to Mobile Application Development" at Vilnius Coding School. 
                        This program taught me both back-end as well as front-end coding. After the courses I've continued to focus more on front-end. </p>
