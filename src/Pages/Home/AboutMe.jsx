                        After few years of managing client accounts, I've decided to change my qualification, as I found a deep interest in programming.
                        This summer I completed a program called "From JAVA Basics to Mobile Application Development" at Vilnius Coding School. This program introduced me to both back-end as well as front-end coding. </p>

                    <p className="hero--section-description"> After the courses I've continued to focus more on front-end development because it allows me to tap into my artistic side and create visually engaging, user-centered experiences. Front-end development gives me the perfect balance between creativity and technical problem-solving, which is why I find it so rewarding.
